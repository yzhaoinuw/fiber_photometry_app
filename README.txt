### Usage
1. After you download and unzip the app, please check that there is a folder called "TDT_files" in the same directory as run_app.exe. If not, please create one.
2. Place all the TDT folders that you like to preprocess in the "TDT_files" folder.

### Note
Once you select a TDT folder and click "Read Data", please give it some time to read the TDT data. It could take up to half a minute. If you wait for more than a minute and still don't see anything happens, there may be something wrong with the data reading process in the app. Please share your data with which the app struggles. I will look into this to fix it.
